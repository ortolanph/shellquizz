  <a name="instructions"><h2>3. Instructions</h2></a>
  <p>To start the fun, first you have to start the main script from a shell as shown below:</p>
  <code>./shellquizz.sh</code>
  <p>Sometimes you can have the following error:</p>
  <code>bash: ./shellquizz.sh: Permission denied</code>
  <p>There are two ways to allow the execution of the script:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>by typing: <code>chmod +x shellquizz.sh</code> on a Terminal window</li>
   <li>by clicking on the option <strong>Allow executing the file as a program</strong> checkbox on the <strong>Permissions</strong> tab of the properties of the file.</li>
  </ol>
  <p><strong>It will not harm your computer anyway. It will just alter the script file to be treated as a program. After doing this is just execute as shown above.</strong></p>
